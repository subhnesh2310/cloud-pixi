            "text": "This module defines an interface for managing alarms.  Main\ninputs to the module design are the 3GPP Alarm Integration\nReference Point (IRP), ITU-T X.733, and ANSI/ISA-18.2 alarm\nstandards.\n\nMain features of this module include:\n\n  * Alarm list:\n            A list of all alarms.  Cleared alarms stay in\n            the list until explicitly purged.\n\n  * Operator actions on alarms:\n            Acknowledging and closing alarms.\n\n  * Administrative actions on alarms:\n            Purging alarms from the list according to specific\n            criteria.\n\n  * Alarm inventory:\n            A management application can read all\n            alarm types implemented by the system.\n\n  * Alarm shelving:\n            Shelving (blocking) alarms according\n            to specific criteria.\n\n  * Alarm profiles:\n            A management system can attach further\n            information to alarm types, for example,\n            overriding system-default severity\n            levels.\n\nThis module uses a stateful view on alarms.  An alarm is a state\nfor a specific resource (note that an alarm is not a\nnotification).  An alarm type is a possible alarm state for a\nresource.  For example, the tuple:\n\n  ('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25')\n\nis an alarm of type 'link-alarm' on the resource\n'GigabitEthernet0/25'.\n\nAlarm types are identified using YANG identities and an optional\nstring-based qualifier.  The string-based qualifier allows for\ndynamic extension of the statically defined alarm types.  Alarm\ntypes identify a possible alarm state and not the individual\nnotifications.  For example, the traditional 'link-down' and\n'link-up' notifications are two notifications referring to the\nsame alarm type 'link-alarm'.\n\nWith this design, there is no ambiguity about how alarm and\nalarm clear correlation should be performed; notifications that\nreport the same resource and alarm type are considered updates\nof the same alarm, e.g., clearing an active alarm or changing\nthe severity of an alarm.  The instrumentation can update the\nseverity and alarm text on an existing alarm.  The above alarm\nexample can therefore look like the following:\n\n  (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),\n   warning,\n   'interface down while interface admin state is up')\n\nThere is a clear separation between updates on the alarm from\nthe underlying resource, like clear, and updates from an\noperator, like acknowledging or closing an alarm:\n\n  (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),\n   warning,\n   'interface down while interface admin state is up',\n   cleared,\n   closed)\n\nAdministrative actions like removing closed alarms older than a\ngiven time is supported.\n\nThis YANG module does not define how the underlying\ninstrumentation detects and clears the specific alarms.  That\nbelongs to the Standards Development Organization (SDO) or\nenterprise that owns that specific technology.\n\nThe key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL\nNOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',\n'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as\ndescribed in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,\nthey appear in all capitals, as shown here.\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 IETF Trust and the persons identified as\nauthors of the code.
