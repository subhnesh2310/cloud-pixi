Section\n3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section\n2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow\nfor current practice in domain name use, and some possible\nfuture expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of\ndomain names, including names used for A or AAAA records\n(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note\nthat Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described\nin RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and\n1123, and that systems that want to store host names in\nschema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to\nadhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.\n\nThe encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited\nto 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels\nprefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL\nbyte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted\nnotation.\n\nThe description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name\ntype MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to\nIP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value\nmay require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4\nand AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and\nwhich DNS record takes precedence can either be defined\nexplicitly or may depend on the configuration of the\nresolver.\n\nDomain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical\nformat uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized\ndomain names MUST be A-labels as per RFC 5890."
